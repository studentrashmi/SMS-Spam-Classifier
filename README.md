# email-spam-classifier-new
End to end code for the email spam classifier project.

1. Objective : To create a system that identifies and filters spam messages from regular SMS.

2. Data Collection : Gather a dataset containing both spam and non-spam (ham) messages.

3. Text Preprocessing
   - Remove unwanted symbols, numbers, and stopwords.
   - Convert the text to lowercase for uniformity.
   - Use techniques like stemming or lemmatization to simplify words.

4. Feature Extraction
   - Use methods like Bag of Words (BoW) or Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to convert text into numerical data.

5. Model Selection
   - Choose algorithms like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Logistic Regression to classify messages.

6. Training the Model : Train the classifier using labeled data (spam/ham messages).

7. Testing & Evaluation
   - Test the model using unseen data to check its accuracy.
   - Evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

8. Deployment : Implement the model in real-time applications to filter incoming SMS for spam detection.

9. Improvements : Continuously update and retrain the model with new data to improve accuracy.

This project helps automate SMS spam detection and protect users from unwanted or harmful messages.
